DIY Loop system contained in a small box

## Description

**This software is still in development, it's not ready for use.**

InsuBox is a DIY Loop system which targets embedded systems, so the hardware size can be minimized. It uses ZephyrOS as a base and can run a variety of hardware.

Intended use case is as a stand alone loop system, so one don't need to carry a phone to run the loop. The system can be configured and monitored via Bluetooth from a phone.
